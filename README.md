# Azure-Resume


## Notes 1
- Frontend folder contains the website
- main.js contains visitor counter code

## Demo site
- You can view the live site via https://resume.ladcze.click
- Alternatively go to https://azureresumestorage1w2c.z33.web.core.windows.net/
- - The counter functions requires some tweak as it isn't working on the live site (but does locally). I hope to rectify this soon. Cheers
